<i>Music</i> uses <a href='https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>NewPipe Extractor</a> to retrieve information and stream data from YouTube/YouTube Music. It's a music player as well, so you can create your own playlists and organize your songs by the artists you create. The aim of Music is to enable everyone to listen to music at no cost by an easy-to-use, practical and ad-free application.
